      "description" : "Auri is a young woman described as appearing a few years older than Kvothe, with blonde hair and a delicate, petite frame. Her hair is long and thin, causing it to float around her head like a halo. She often displays very proper manners and conducts herself with a gentle and careful air. Although she lives in a rather dangerous environment and sometimes displays extremely eccentric behavior, she is very intelligent and quite capable of taking care of herself. She also is shown to be skilled in alchemy and possibly naming. Elodin tells Kvothe that he has known about Auri for years. This along with her young appearance would mean she was inducted in the University at a very young age. This also implies she may be older than she appears. The name Auri is similar to 'aureum', which means 'gold' or 'golden' in Latin. This may be related to her blonde hair.",

She is described as having pale, smooth skin that shimmers in the moonlight, and long black hair \"like a sheaf of shadows.\" She has a petal-shaped mouth and dark, curious eyes. Her eyelids are patterned with designs resembling a butterfly's wings.\n\nDue to Felurian's erotic disposition, she is almost always nude. She enjoys music, often personally enticing men with the sound of her singing. She is infamous in legend for seducing human men with her beauty, inevitably to either kill them through sexual exhaustion or to drive them insane. However, Kvothe learns during his encounter with Felurian that it is not necessarily her excessive lust that drives men to madness - rather, after she eventually tires of her lovers and sends them away, they go mad from wanting her.",
